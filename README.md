## Resources

- [W3Schools - Increments](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arithmetic.asp): I looked up how to add one to the previous number of clicks for the JS on branch "Listener"

- [W3Schools - Value of Input](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/coll_form_elements.asp): I looked up how to get the values that were entered into form fields.

## Deductions

> I have reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments
- So, I considered using [MDN - Events - Clicks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/click) for the "Listener" branch. I had looked up this way of counting the number of clicks using `event.detail` but then you had sent out the email about using increments, so I changed my code back to the version using increments.

  - I did leave the `event.detail` code as commented out on GitHub because I think I would use that version in real life...it has less code - no need to define a variable or have the system add one...it's just naturally counting the clicks!


- I liked this assignment! I felt like I can finally start to see the real world applications of JavaScript on the web!
